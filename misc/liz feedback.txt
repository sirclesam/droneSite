Hey Sam, thats awesome! I don't have much time at the moment so I'll keep my initial impressions brief:
- You need a "Home" link. Have a featured video highlight reel (see multirotor cam for some examples) and perhaps an image slider with 4-5 of the best photos.
Add a testimonials page
list clients you have worked with (which brokerages) how many homes have you photographed, etc. - Social Proof is where it's at. Link to some of these listings online if you can.
Move your About to a separate page instead of the bottom of the page
Research research research - why reinvent the wheel when you can copy the format of super duper successful photographers out there?! Thats what I do with a lot of my business.
If you're not set on your logo incorporate something that eludes to aerial photography somehow.
...the photo of the garden looks like a cross in a cemetary
Some of the photos you've featured are a little to dark for what many realtors would be after

final thought for now: use different sized fonts to help your headers and key information standout have a "CONTACT" tab up top that either (1) is a mailto: hyperlink or takes people
to a contact page with your phone and email at the top and links to social media as well as a form where people can submit an inquiry
